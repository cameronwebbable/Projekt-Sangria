#Projekt Sangra

#### What is this noise? 
> In short, it's a web-application that helps you decide whether or not to trust ESPN's projections based on past weeks in comparison
> with the total.

#### Why the hell are you doing this? NFL went into a lockout.
> I wanted to write a rails application from scratch. Not to mention, I wanted to be able to have a possible competitive edge against the competion. I hate losing :).

#### So wait, why is this on git hub?
> Psh, why the heck not? Everything from web-scraping to Rails Hawtness is involved here. I may not be a master developer, but we sharing code helps the world go round.

#### Is this README finished?
> Nope, still still working on it.
