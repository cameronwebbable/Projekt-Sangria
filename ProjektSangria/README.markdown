#### What is this noise? 
In short, it's a web-application that helps you decide whether or not to trust ESPN's projections based on past weeks in comparison with the total.

#### Why the hell are you doing this? NFL went into a lockout.
I wanted to write a rails application from scratch. Not to mention, I wanted to be able to have a possible competitive edge against the competion. I hate losing :).

#### So wait, why is this on git hub?
Psh, why the heck not? Everything from web-scraping to Rails Hawtness are involved here. I may not be a master developer, but we all know sharing code helps the world go round.

#### Is this README finished?
Nope, still still working on it.
